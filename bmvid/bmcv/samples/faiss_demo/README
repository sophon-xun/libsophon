install:
cmake -B build .
make install -C build

run:
install/TpuIndexFlatdemo
if failed becase not find library,you can export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$PWD/install:$PWD


attention:
1.index is 32bit, not 64 bit
2.database memory now is limited to 2GB, later can be changed
3.if transpose is set to 0, random data is made in transpose mode.
